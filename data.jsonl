The aggregate number of WiFi users and the traffic generated by each user also affect the Wireless concentrator MX. Ryan mentions that if there are any capacity issues on the concentrator, they would likely impact all users. Therefore, it's advisable to avoid reaching its maximum capacity. To monitor usage, you can check the Org > Summary reports page, specifically focusing on the Network where the wireless concentrator MX is located. Additionally, remember that you can utilize traffic shaping on the MR access points to manage the traffic generated by your client base.
